        <br>
        <p class="text-xl">Our team addresses water pollution by utilizing dams as natural water filters. These dams effectively trap various pollutants, preventing their spread and safeguarding water quality.These Dams also cause  a decrease in vegetation which leads to new communiteies for many different plants that can be beneficial. Dams changes water levels and water chemistry which is positive for plants and the ocean but negative to some species that live in the ocean. New habbitats for plants are caused by damas which is a good thing but a bad thing because the water is being filtered and some species might be able to increase and survive over time while others cant. </p>
