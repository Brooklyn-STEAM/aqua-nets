            <p>Water is the foundation of all life on Earth. It covers about 71% of our planet and makes up a large part of every living thing—from humans and animals to plants and microscopic organisms. Water fuels our ecosystems, powers natural cycles like the water cycle and climate regulation, and supports everything from growing food to generating energy. Whether it’s a rainforest, a coral reef, or a single drop of rain, water keeps our world alive and balanced. Without it, life simply couldn’t exist.</p>
